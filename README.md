<h1>Virtual Bookshelf</h1>
This project seeks to create a web application that allows the user to create a book and have it display on the bookshelf. The bookshelf should have a function to mark the book has been read and a button to remove the book from the bookshelf. This project is based on the project outlined by The Odin Project in practicing Javascript and implementing JS objects within a DOM.
